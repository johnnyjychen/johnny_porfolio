            <h1>UX Research - KISS</h1>
            <h2>Project Information</h2>
            <p><span class="highlight">Overview</span>:
                In this project, our team collaborated with KISS, an app designed to promote sexual health awareness and safer practices through features like anonymous notifications. We conducted extensive UX research for the app and focused on enabling users to log sexual activities and share their health status with partners. Our work included user interviews, surveys, comparative analyses, heuristic evaluations, and usability testing.

                    <p><span class='highlight-green'>What we did?</span> We interviewed five sexually active individuals to enhance the KISS app's usability and understand attitudes toward sexual health and the app's key features, such as QR code encounter registration and anonymous STI test result notifications.</p></br>
                    <p><span class='highlight-green'>What we got?</span> Participants preferred official STI test result verification over verbal assurances, which highlights the need for secure storage and sharing of medical results. Concerns about data safety, anonymity, and privacy control were prominent, alongside skepticism about self-submitted results. 
                        Recommendations include integrating verified result sharing, implementing robust data protection, customizable privacy settings, and a medical institution-linked verification system.</p>

                    <p><span class='highlight-green'>What we did?</span> We conducted a pilot survey using stratified sampling to understand attitudes toward STI prevention, testing habits, and anonymous notification systems. This included refining survey instruments through pilot testing and addressing issues like question clarity, response options, and usability.</p></br>
                    <p><span class='highlight-green'>What we got?</span> Participants highlighted concerns about data security, the authenticity of anonymous test results, and the effectiveness of anonymous notifications. Key insights include a preference for simplified response scales, clear navigation, and improved communication channels. These findings inform recommendations for enhancing the KISS app's features and usability.</p>

                    <p><span class='highlight-green'>What we did?</span> We conducted a comparative analysis of the KISS app using SWOT analysis and feature comparisons with competitors like Sexual Activity, Kama, Nice, STD Triage, and SLog. The evaluation focused on privacy, user experience, educational content, and pricing strategies to identify areas for improvement.</p></br>
                    <p><span class='highlight-green'>What we got?</span> Key findings reveal that eliminating sign-up processes enhances privacy and ease of access, intuitive navigation (e.g., a floating 'plus' button) improves activity logging, and structured educational content boosts user engagement. Recommendations include simplifying account creation, redesigning navigation for accessibility, incorporating educational features, and introducing clinic-finding and online diagnosis functionalities.</p>

                    <p><span class='highlight-green'>What we got?</span> The app's structured user flow and system feedback provide a clear and intuitive experience, but limitations in editing records, confusing icons and titles, and a lack of minimalist design hinder usability. Recommendations include enhancing user control, clarifying navigation elements, and redesigning visual components for a cleaner, more user-friendly interface.</p>

This included pre- and post-questionnaires, background questions, and five tasks to evaluate the KISS app's features. A pilot test refined the process, adding a three-minute limit for tasks participants found difficult.</p></br>
                    <p><span class='highlight-green'>What we got?</span> Participants struggled with complex activity logging, unclear icons, and QR code navigation. Recommendations include streamlining activity addition with a clear "Add New" button, refining icons, and improving QR code accessibility. Additional issues with STI result checkboxes, facility selection, and notification processes led to suggestions for intuitive design updates, clearer messaging, and enhanced user feedback mechanisms.</p>
