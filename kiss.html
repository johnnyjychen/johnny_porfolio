                In this project, our group assisted our clients in conducting a range of UX research for the KISS
                app, which enabled users to log their sexual activities and share their sexual health status with
                partners. Our work included user interviews, surveys, comparative evaluations, heuristic evaluations,
                and user
                testing in a course.

                    The KISS app enables QR code encounter registration and anonymous STI test result notifications. We interviewed five diverse and sexually active individuals to enhance the app's usability and understand user perspectives on sexual health. The key recommendations included adding a feature for sharing verified STI results, enhancing data protection, providing customizable privacy settings, and enabling direct submission of verified results. Key recommendations include adding a feature to share verified STI test results, implementing strong data protection measures, offering customizable privacy settings, and enabling direct submission of verified test results. The research aims to explore attitudes toward sexual activities outside one’s circle and perceptions of the app’s core features.

                    We synthesized a pilot survey and participant feedback designed to gauge potential KISS APP users' attitudes towards STI prevention, perspectives on STI testing, and receptiveness to an anonymous notification feature. The pilot testing process ensured survey validity, helped identify logical discrepancies, and accurately discerned user needs and insights sought by our client. These results informed the app's development and enhancements, aligning with user expectations and contributing to STI prevention initiatives.

                    We analyzed five competitors, one for each type, to provide an overview but limiting the depth of analysis and potentially introducing bias. As Goodman (2012) notes, biases and assumptions about our application may also cause us to overlook some competitors. Our findings were derived by summarizing common insights across competitors, but this approach risks missing uncommon yet important findings. Next, with insights gathered from users and competitors, we will shift focus to our product. We plan to conduct a heuristic evaluation to assess design and usability tests to evaluate functionality and user experience.

                    We conducted several heuristic analyses of the KISS application. The analysis of the KISS application revealed both strengths and weaknesses. Positively, the well-structured user flow for the three major use cases tested ensures ease of use. The “New Scanning” page mimics a real-world clinic, making data input intuitive. Additionally, feedback and system status updates keep users informed. However, the app limits editing or deleting past records, restricting user control. Icons and page titles on the “New Kiss” and “New Screening” pages are unclear, causing confusion. The app also lacks aesthetic and minimalist design, making information difficult to read and navigate. To address these issues, we recommended enabling users to edit and delete records, improve icon clarity and page titles with descriptive text, and redesign visual elements like the calendar and color scheme. These changes would enhance navigation and readability while providing a cleaner, more user-friendly interface.

                    To enhance feedback on the KISS app's features, we conducted user testing on more users to observe behaviors and gathering feedback. User interviews revealed challenges in the activity addition process and icon ambiguity, especially for logging encounters and navigating QR codes. Recommendations include adding a prominent "Add New" button, clearer icons, and improved QR code navigation and accessibility. For screening results, users struggled with checkbox symbols for STI results and the lack of physician names in dropdown menus. Refinements should include intuitive checkboxes, detailed physician information, and a simplified facility addition process with prompt feedback. STI notifications posed difficulties with locating the send button and understanding the interface. Improving email visibility, clarifying messaging context, and redesigning the interface can address these issues.
