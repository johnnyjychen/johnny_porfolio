            <h2>Project Information</h2>
            <p><span class="highlight">Overview</span>:
                In this project, our group assisted our clients in conducting a range of UX research for the KISS
                app, which enabled users to log their sexual activities and share their sexual health status with
                partners. Our work included user interviews, surveys, comparative evaluations, heuristic evaluations,
                and user
                testing in a course.

                    Our client was the KISS app, featuring QR code registrations and anonymous STI notifications. We
                    interviewed five diverse, sexually active individuals to enhance the app's usability and understand
                    user perspectives on sexual health. The key recommendations included adding a feature for sharing
                    verified STI results, enhancing data protection, providing customizable privacy settings, and
                    enabling direct submission of verified results. Our research aimed to explore attitudes towards
                    sexual activities outside one's usual circle and gather feedback on the app's main features.

                    We synthesized a pilot survey and participant feedback designed to gauge potential KISS APP users'
                    attitudes towards STI prevention, perspectives on STI testing, and receptiveness to an anonymous
                    notification feature. The pilot testing process ensured survey validity, helped identify logical
                    discrepancies, and accurately discerned user needs and insights sought by our client. These results
                    informed the app's development and enhancements, aligning with user expectations and contributing to
                    STI prevention initiatives.

                    We conducted comparative evaluations of the KISS app and other sexual wellness applications using
                    SWOT analysis and feature comparison methods. We evaluated competitors including Sexual Activity,
                    Kama, Nice, STD Triage, and SLog. Key findings emphasized privacy, user-friendly design, and the
                    importance of educational content, notably the privacy-enhancing aspect of non-required sign-ups.
                    Recommendations included minimizing sign-up processes, refining navigation, enhancing educational
                    content, and adding features like clinic finding and online diagnosis to improve user experience and
                    market positioning of the KISS app.

                    In this research, we conducted several heuristic analyses of the KISS application. The KISS app was
                    designed to enhance sexual wellness and prevent the spread of STIs through features like anonymous
                    partner notifications. This analysis focused on evaluating the app's usability, especially the “Main
                    Page,” "New Kiss," and "New Screening" pages, to identify usability issues and recommend
                    improvements.

                    To enhance feedback on the KISS app's features, we conducted user testing on more users, observing
                    behaviors and gathering feedback. We developed a user testing protocol with a pre-questionnaire,
                    background questions, five tasks, and a post-questionnaire. After a team member piloted this script
                    and identified potential improvements, we added a three-minute limit for tasks if interviewees
                    struggled. With five team members, each conducted a test with one interviewee, recording the
                    sessions for analysis.
