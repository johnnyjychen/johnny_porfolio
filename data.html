            <h2>Project Information</h2>
            <p><span class="highlight">Overview</span>: For this project, I downloaded a dataset about animated movies from 
                <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tarundalal/animated-movies-imdb" target="_blank">Kaggle</a> and then used R to analyze it. This data contained various information, 
                such as rating, genre, year, and runtime, of 85 movies.
                I chose this dataset because there are many movies that I have watched and really liked. Therefore, I would like to find the relationship between some of the information (variables) provided.

            <h2>Data Visualization</h2>
            <p>I would like to visualize some data first, so I could have a general understanding of some specific variables that I was interested in.</p></br>
            <h3>1. The relationship between the year and the rating</h3>
            <p>I was interested in whether there was a relationship between the year and the rating. 
                These two variables were both numerical, and there was an inherent ordering to the variable, year. 
                Therefore, I used the linegraph to visualize the dataset.
            </p>
            <p><strong>a. Below was the codes.</strong></p>

                <p class="indented_20">scale_x_continuous(limits = c(1925, 2025)) +</p>

            <h3>2. The relationship between the runtime and the rating.</h3>
            <p> Then, I wanted to know the relationship between the runtime and the rating.
                These two variables were both numerical, but they did not have an inherent ordering.
                Therefore, I used the scatterplot to visualize the dataset.
            </p>

            <h3>3. The count of different genres</h3>
            <p>
                Finally, I also would like to know the count of different genres of these movies.
                Because it was a categorical variable, I used the barplot to visualize it.
                Below was the codes.

            <h2>Hypothesis Testing</h2>
            <p>As I mentioned above, I would like to study the relationship between the variable, Runtime, and the variable, Rating.
                Therefore, I made two hypotheses:
            </p>
            <p>H0: There is no relationship between the runtime and the rating.</p>
            <p>H1: There is a relationship between the runtime and the rating.</p></br>

            <p>Becasue the p-value was 0.036, which was greater than the α (0.05 in this case). 
                Therefore, I successfully rejected the null hypothesis and accepted the alternative hypothesis.
