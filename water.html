            <h2>Project Information</h2>
            <p><span class="highlight">Overview</span>:
                Our group spent three months studying the problems of Michigan municipalities collecting, standardizing,
                and sharing data with each other. We first explained what our research questions were and why they were
                worth studying. Then we described the methods we used to collect data from different parties over the
                past few months. We summarized the insights that we got from the data. Because we know that existing
                research is not sufficient to solve these problems, we discussed how we would further address the issues
                if we had unlimited time and resources. Finally, we concluded the most important points of our study.

                <p class="problem_statment">Michigan's water infrastructure suffers from a lack of standardized data
                    across municipalities,
                    making it difficult to assess and improve quality and safety. Many systems are outdated and suffer
                    from poor record-keeping and underfunding, hindering effective communication and resource
                    allocation. Some areas with excellent data show potential for statewide
                    improvement.</p>

                <p class="problem_statment">We reviewed literature on Michigan's aging water infrastructure and the
                    challenges in collecting data to assess its condition. The infrastructure is in poor shape and
                    mostly unrecorded because it was built before the digital age, making it hard to analyze its current
                    state and address issues like old pipes and health risks. The absence of detailed records and
                    difficulties in data gathering make solving these problems tough. Poor communication between
                    different municipalities also worsens the situation, causing the infrastructure to deteriorate even
                    faster. Better collaboration and data collection are crucial to manage these aging infrastructures
                    and
                    prevent further damage.</p>

                    To find enough evidence to support our problem statement to be worth investigating and to better

                    we first did some research on Google Scholar and various water service websites.
                    We found ten sources in total and created a Google sheet to help us summarize those results and
                    found

                    Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE), using a structured interview protocol for clarity. The entire team
                    attended an interview
                    at the Ann Arbor water plant.
                    Two members also conducted a joint

                    Michigan collects extensive data on water infrastructure, but analysis is incomplete. There are gaps
                    in
                    data about the precise locations and conditions of all infrastructure. The state uses three main
                    methods
                    for data management: a system interface for operator-equipment interaction, annual monitoring of
                    170,000
                    water quality tests with public reports, and a comprehensive database storing equipment and

                    However, the interviews revealed that while Michigan has extensive water
                    infrastructure databases, they are not enough. There's a crucial need for more in-depth analysis to
                    fully utilize this data. Next step is to investigate beneficial types of analyses and implementing
                    them
                    is a priority. Additionally, there are significant gaps in certain water infrastructure data, which,
                    according to experts, may take decades to fully understand and address. These gaps hinder effective
                    maintenance and replacement strategies, emphasizing the need for improved data management and public
                    accessibility.

                    Another finding is that water infrastructure data can't always be standardized, nor is it always
                    helpful
                    for it to be standardized. Despite the supportive stance
                    on the standardization of data, the interviewee in the contextual interview mentioned that there is
                    no
                    one size fits all template for data because every project is different. A balance should be struck
                    between standardization for ease of access and customization to better elaborate on specific
                    circumstances.

                    Based on our interview with an employee from the Ann Arbor Water Department, we learned that they
                    prioritize infrastructure repair and maintenance in two main ways. One method is reactive,
                    addressing main breaks and visible failures, and prioritizing repairs through capital improvement
                    projects based on monitored data. The other method focuses on water quality, where signs of
                    contamination indicate decaying pipes that need replacement. Decisions on whether to repair or
                    replace are driven by cost-effectiveness analysis.

                <p class="problem_statment">
                    A finding about communication across municipalities is that there are research databases made
                    available
                    by the Water Research Foundation and American Waterworks Foundation as well as their local Michigan
                    chapter.
                    They collect data from research done by different municipalities. When organizations have projects
                    they
                    want to carry out,
                    they can first take a look at the research databases to save time and resources.
                    When facing issues, municipalities can also communicate with individual consultants and engineers
                    who
                    have worked for different water departments in addition to theirs.

                    According to Natasha Blakely's article and our interviews, while the EGLE advocates for
                    consolidating water infrastructure to support municipalities with shrinking populations and
                    oversized systems, there are risks. A larger distribution area means problems affect more people and
                    increase operational costs. Skepticism arises from evaluating the financial benefits against
                    potential risks, as states must consider the impact of consolidation on both the financial strain
                    and the increased risk of widespread service disruption.

                        perspectives better. Additionally, we aim to access and delve deeper into two key databases—the
                        American Water Works Association and the Water Research Foundation—to improve our interview
                        questions. Lastly, exploring how transparency in infrastructure data affects funding decisions
                        would
