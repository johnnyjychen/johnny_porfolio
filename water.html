            <h1>Report - Analysis of the Michigan Municipalities on Collecting, Analyzing, and Sharing data of Water
                Infrastructures</h1>
            <h2>Project Information</h2>
            <p><span class="highlight">Overview</span>:
                Our group spent three months studying the problems of Michigan municipalities collecting, standardizing,
                and sharing data with each other. We first explained what our research questions were and why they were
                worth studying. Then we described the methods we used to collect data from different parties over the
                past few months. We summarized the insights that we got from the data. Because we know that existing
                research is not sufficient to solve these problems, we discussed how we would further address the issues
                if we had unlimited time and resources. Finally, we concluded the most important points of our study.
                We wrote this report together, so we could demonstrate what we have done in this project.

            <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
            <p>Michigan currently lacks a way to review data on the status and quality of water infrastructure from
                multiple municipalities simultaneously (Lupher, Schneider, and Dennis 3). There exists no
                standardization between municipalities in the way water infrastructure quality is recorded and reported,
                resulting in many unknowns and lost information when attempting to investigate quality at scale (Lupher,
                Schneider, and Dennis 16). This can directly affect citizens' access to water that is confirmed clean
                and safe. Investigative agents who require congruent data for assessing infrastructure risk may lack the
                ability to properly obtain and analyze said data. Officials who determine where to send funding might
                not have the tools to properly allocate resources regarding water infrastructure projects.
            </p></br>

            <p>
                Much of Michigan's water infrastructure predates efficient methods for data collection, and likely
                predates many federal, state, and local requirements and standards for tracking quality and upkeep.
                Alongside a major lack of funding, this has perpetuated poor record keeping and a general unknowing of
                the true state of water infrastructure in Michigan. Municipalities do not appear privy to communicate
                effectively with each other on the subject, and it is thought that the longer these issues persist, the
                quicker Michigan's water infrastructure deteriorates (Lupher, Schneider, and Dennis 17). Lupher,
                Schneider, and Dennis also mention that there are some water infrastructure systems in Michigan with
                excellent data, indicating possibility for improvement around the board.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="project_content">
            <h2>Background Research</h2>
            <p>The condition of Michigan's water infrastructure is accepted to be poor, but is largely unknown. Water
                infrastructure is underground, and much of it was installed before digital record keeping, making
                condition assessment costly and difficult.” (Lupher, Schneider, and Dennis 3).</p></br>
            <p>The records of data on Michigan's water infrastructure are almost unknown because it was not properly
                recorded before it was established (“Michigan's Path To A Prosperous Future”). This makes it difficult
                to analyze the current issues we have now, such as the aging of water pipes and adverse effects on
                residents' health. Michigan currently does not possess comprehensive records regarding the state of its
                aging water infrastructure. It lacks both the capability and authority to gather data related to the
                water system's financial health (Walton 1). However, to address issues about aging water infrastructure,
                it is necessary to obtain detailed information about various facets of aging water infrastructure (Rath
                11). Due to the lack of data, issues are difficult to solve (Vedachalam et al. 872). Collaboration
                between municipalities may also provide solutions. However, “municipalities do not appear privy to
                communicate effectively with each other on the subject, and it is thought that the longer these issues
                persist, the quicker Michigan's water infrastructure deteriorates” (Lupher, Schneider, and Dennis 17).
                Deterioration of infrastructure does not happen at a linear rate, “and it is thought that the longer
                these issues persist, the quicker Michigan's water infrastructure deteriorates” (Lupher, Schneider, and
                Dennis 17).</p>

            <h2>Research Questions</h2>
            <p>What are the methods different municipalities are using to assess water infrastructure quality,
                including maintenance and replacement needs? Where is this succeeding or failing?</p>
            </br>
            <p>In the process of collecting data on water infrastructure,
                how can the measuring and sharing of information between different municipalities be enhanced? If so,
                what is it?</p>
        </div>

        <div class="project_content">
            <h2>Process</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                To find enough evidence to support our problem statement to be worth investigating and to better
                identify what current issues are severe,
                we first did some research on Google Scholar and various water service websites.
                We found ten sources in total and created a Google sheet to help us summarize those results and found
                what is important and points of overlap.
                With these results, we were able not only to specify the issues we wanted to study but also to generate
                more relevant questions for our interviews.
                </li></br>

                <li>
                    Additionally, each member of our group selected a subject matter expert (SME) video interview and to
                    conduct analysis on.
                    We used this opportunity to practice asking questions and taking notes in the interview. We shared what
                    we found in those video interviews and saw which ideas were relevant to aging water infrastructure and
                    our research question. Additionally, each member participated in SME interviews with various
                    stakeholders.
                    Johnny attended the Zoom interview with Molly Maciejewski, Dawn attended the Zoom interview with Noah
                    Urban, and the rest of group members attended the Zoom interview with Evan Pratt. We tried to find what
                    was relevant to our topic throughout the interview process, but kept ourselves open to exploring other
                    newly-discovered points of interest.
                    For example, consolidation of not just the data, but of the literal water infrastructure itself was
                    posed several times by interviewees.
                    This was a more contentious point as we had collected conflicting opinions.
                </li></br>

                <li>
                    To obtain more firsthand information,
                    we conducted interviews with various professional stakeholders from the City of Ann Arbor and EGLE.
                    We finished an interview protocol so we could ask questions in a more logical way in the interviews.
                    The whole team was present when we conducted a contextual interview with an employee from the City of
                    Ann Arbor water plant.
                    Dawn and Jonathan were the interviewers. The rest of our group members took notes and uploaded our notes
                    to Google Drive so we could all compare and review them later.
                    Dawn and Aishah went to a joint interview with staff from EGLE, which helped reinforce prior
                    observations regarding water infrastructure consolidation.
                </li></br>

                <li>
                    After we collected all of the data from various parties,
                    we started working on our affinity wall via Miro. We extracted the core ideas from different sources and
                    summarized them in one sentence,
                    then wrote them on yellow sticky notes. After that, we roughly categorized them.
                    Next, we went over and discussed whether each categorization is reasonable together, and made
                    adjustments accordingly.
                    We wrote a sentence to summarize each category on a blue sticky note.
                    Then we conducted the second categorization and used pink sticky notes to summarize them.
                    Finally, we divided pink sticky notes into two parts and used green sticky notes to mark their
                    differences.
                    All of these works allowed us to find what was in common and what was important,
                    and therefore we could present our findings to others.

            <h2>Findings/Insights</h2>
            <p>
                We found that Michigan collects and stores robust amounts of data regarding some aspects of water
                infrastructure but does not fully analyze all of it, whereas there are gaps in other kinds of data, like
                comprehensive data relating to the locations and current statuses of all water infrastructure in
                Michigan. According to a contextual interview we conducted with an employee of the Ann Arbor Water
                Department, Michigan currently has three main ways for collecting and storing data. First is a status
                system, which is an interface between operator and equipment. The state monitors and stores data
                acquired through the system in databases. They use the data for treating water and maintaining the
                distribution system. Additionally, the state monitors the 170,000 water tests related to quality and
                contamination annually. They generate reports based on the results, which are available to the public.
                Lastly, Michigan has a database that stores equipment records, maintenance records, staffing
                information, engineering plans, and GIS information.
            </p>
            </br>
            <p>However, the contextual interview revealed that there is not enough analysis done on the data, despite
                the size of the databases. It was mentioned that there is a need for further analysis to get the full
                utility out of the data. Next step is to investigate the types of analysis that will benefit the water
                department and to devise methods to implement those analyses. Additionally, other aspects of water
                infrastructure data are lacking and have significant gaps. For example according to Eric Lupher, Robert
                Schneider, and Eric Paul Dennis in Michigan's Path to a Prosperous Future: Infrastructure Challenges and
                Opportunities, “it will likely require decades of focused attention to attain an appropriate
                understanding of water infrastructure in Michigan,” due to these gaps in data and according to Olivia
                Rath in State of the State: Michigan's Infrastructure, "a lack of clear, publicly available and
                aggregated information about water infrastructure assets has impeded strategic maintenance and
                replacement.”</p>
            </br>
            <p>Another finding is that water infrastructure data can't always be standardized, nor is it always helpful
                for it to be standardized. Some point out that the state lacking a central repository of information
                about system size, water production and rates (Walton), and having “coordinated data aggregation can
                inform a systematic approach to” water infrastructure maintenance (Rath). Despite the supportive stance
                on the standardization of data, the interviewee in the contextual interview mentioned that there is no
                one size fits all template for data because every project is different. A balance should be struck
                between standardization for ease of access and customization to better elaborate on specific
                circumstances.</p>
            </br>
            <p>We also discovered that there are two main ways for water departments to select infrastructure for repair
                and maintenance, based on priority, according to our interview with an employee of the Ann Arbor Water
                Department. One is based on failures such as main breaks. If the data monitored by organizations shows
                pipes are in disrepair and need to be replaced, they get put on capital improvement projects. They
                assess the highest priorities to plan the financial matters. The other way is based on water quality.
                Contaminated water suggests decay in water pipes, and the water department decides to replace them.
                Decisions regarding repair and maintenance are made based on cost analysis. Whether it is cheaper to
                repair or replace will vary.</p>
            </br>
            <p>A finding about communication across municipalities is that there are research databases made available
                by the Water Research Foundation and American Waterworks Foundation as well as their local Michigan
                chapter.
                They collect data from research done by different municipalities. When organizations have projects they
                want to carry out,
                they can first take a look at the research databases to save time and resources.
                When facing issues, municipalities can also communicate with individual consultants and engineers who
                have worked for different water departments in addition to theirs.</p>
            </br>
            <p>Lastly, we learned that while the Department of Environment,
                Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE) recommends consolidation of water infrastructure, some are skeptical of
                this.
                The article by Natasha Blakely pointed out the population size in some municipalities is decreasing in
                spite of the initial expectation that it would grow bigger.
                In order to support the oversized water infrastructure, EGLE advocates for sharing resources between
                municipalities who are financially struggling to maintain their own by themselves. On the other hand,
                we cannot ignore that having a large distribution area creates a risk, as mentioned in our contextual
                interview with the Ann Arbor Water Department employee.
                With a larger consolidated area of water service, single problems will affect a larger amount of the
                population.
                Furthermore, pumping water throughout a bigger distribution area is expensive. The contextual interview
                further emphasized that states have to evaluate the financial benefit of infrastructure consolidation
                against the potential risk.</p>
        </div>


        <div class="project_content">
            <h2>Next Steps</h2>
            <p>
                Although we uncovered many valuable findings,
                it is clear that our current investigations were insufficient to yield fully fledged recommendations.
                Therefore, we considered what we would do if we had more time and resources.
                First, we would need to interview more stakeholders.
                Our two interviews expressed conflicting opinions, so we would need to speak to more people to clarify
                solutions and figure out what factors contribute to the differing views.
                Interviewing more stakeholders would ideally include a wider variety of people in order to get the full
                picture. Second, we want to get access to and further explore the two aforementioned databases that
                exist as a way for various municipalities to communicate data.
                Gathering more information on the search functionalities and content between the American Water Works
                Association database and the Water Research Foundation database can enable more informative interview
                questions.
                Lastly, investigating the transparency of infrastructure data and how it ties into funding decisions
                would prove effective for furthering context among all stakeholders.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="project_content">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Through our data collection, we learned about some of the reasons why Michigan's water infrastructure is
                so unknown when it comes to its quality.
                We discovered a lack of comprehensive data when it comes to said quality, and that municipalities do
                already try their best to communicate findings with each other in indirect ways, such as through
                reporting databases they can publish to.
                We also found out data and infrastructure consolidation can yield contrary opinions. Some stakeholders
                are largely in favor, and some exhibit a request for caution. After reviewing our interview pool and
                data sources, we realized a lack of diverse stakeholders was a potential issue for missing parts of the
                whole picture.
                We determined that obtaining more stakeholder perspectives from water customers and political leaders
                would be paramount in furthering our project. We also figured that getting access to the two popular
                databases and observing user workflows through them would be invaluable for further exploration.
                Ultimately, there are clear efforts by various stakeholders to improve Michigan's water infrastructure.
                Having learned of the different aspects that Michigan water infrastructure is more ahead than we had
                previously thought, we feel more eager than wary about the future of Michigan's water infrastructure.
