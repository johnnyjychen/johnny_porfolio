            <h2>Project Information</h2>
            <p><span class="highlight">Overview</span>:
                Our group spent three months studying the problems of Michigan municipalities collecting, standardizing,
                and sharing data with each other. We first explained what our research questions were and why they were
                worth studying. Then we described the methods we used to collect data from different parties over the
                past few months. We summarized the insights that we got from the data. Because we know that existing
                research is not sufficient to solve these problems, we discussed how we would further address the issues
                if we had unlimited time and resources. Finally, we concluded the most important points of our study.

                <p class="problem_statment">Michigan's water infrastructure suffers from a lack of standardized data
                    across municipalities,
                    making it difficult to assess and improve quality and safety. Many systems are outdated and suffer
                    from poor record-keeping and underfunding, hindering effective communication and resource
                    allocation. Some areas with excellent data show potential for statewide

                    challenges in collecting data to assess its condition. The infrastructure is in poor shape and
                    mostly unrecorded because it was built before the digital age, making it hard to analyze its current
                    state and address issues like old pipes and health risks. The absence of detailed records and
                    difficulties in data gathering make solving these problems tough. Poor communication between
                    different municipalities also worsens the situation, causing the infrastructure to deteriorate even
                    faster. Better collaboration and data collection are crucial to manage these aging infrastructures
                    and
                    prevent further damage.</p>

            <h2>Process</h2>
            <h3>The progress of the entire project is shown below</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    To find enough evidence to support our problem statement to be worth investigating and to better
                    identify what current issues are severe,
                    we first did some research on Google Scholar and various water service websites.
                    We found ten sources in total and created a Google sheet to help us summarize those results and
                    found
                    what is important and points of overlap.
                    With these results, we were able not only to specify the issues we wanted to study but also to
                    generate
                    more relevant questions for our interviews.
                </li></br>

                <li>
                    Additionally, each member of our group selected a subject matter expert (SME) video interview and to
                    conduct analysis on.
                    We used this opportunity to practice asking questions and taking notes in the interview. We shared
                    what
                    we found in those video interviews and saw which ideas were relevant to aging water infrastructure
                    and
                    our research question. Additionally, each member participated in SME interviews with various
                    stakeholders.
                    Johnny attended the Zoom interview with Molly Maciejewski, Dawn attended the Zoom interview with
                    Noah
                    Urban, and the rest of group members attended the Zoom interview with Evan Pratt. We tried to find
                    what
                    was relevant to our topic throughout the interview process, but kept ourselves open to exploring
                    other
                    newly-discovered points of interest.
                    For example, consolidation of not just the data, but of the literal water infrastructure itself was
                    posed several times by interviewees.
                    This was a more contentious point as we had collected conflicting opinions.
                </li></br>

                <li>
                    To obtain more firsthand information,
                    we conducted interviews with various professional stakeholders from the City of Ann Arbor and EGLE.
                    We finished an interview protocol so we could ask questions in a more logical way in the interviews.
                    The whole team was present when we conducted a contextual interview with an employee from the City
                    of
                    Ann Arbor water plant.
                    Dawn and Jonathan were the interviewers. The rest of our group members took notes and uploaded our
                    notes
                    to Google Drive so we could all compare and review them later.
                    Dawn and Aishah went to a joint interview with staff from EGLE, which helped reinforce prior
                    observations regarding water infrastructure consolidation.
                </li></br>

                <li>
                    After we collected all of the data from various parties,
                    we started working on our affinity wall via Miro. We extracted the core ideas from different sources
                    and
                    summarized them in one sentence,
                    then wrote them on yellow sticky notes. After that, we roughly categorized them.
                    Next, we went over and discussed whether each categorization is reasonable together, and made
                    adjustments accordingly.
                    We wrote a sentence to summarize each category on a blue sticky note.
                    Then we conducted the second categorization and used pink sticky notes to summarize them.
                    Finally, we divided pink sticky notes into two parts and used green sticky notes to mark their
                    differences.
                    All of these works allowed us to find what was in common and what was important,
                    and therefore we could present our findings to others.

            <h2>Findings/Insights</h2>
            <p>
                We found that Michigan collects and stores robust amounts of data regarding some aspects of water
                infrastructure but does not fully analyze all of it, whereas there are gaps in other kinds of data, like
                comprehensive data relating to the locations and current statuses of all water infrastructure in
                Michigan. According to a contextual interview we conducted with an employee of the Ann Arbor Water
                Department, Michigan currently has three main ways for collecting and storing data. First is a status
                system, which is an interface between operator and equipment. The state monitors and stores data
                acquired through the system in databases. They use the data for treating water and maintaining the
                distribution system. Additionally, the state monitors the 170,000 water tests related to quality and
                contamination annually. They generate reports based on the results, which are available to the public.
                Lastly, Michigan has a database that stores equipment records, maintenance records, staffing
                information, engineering plans, and GIS information.
            </p>
            </br>
            <p>However, the contextual interview revealed that there is not enough analysis done on the data, despite
                the size of the databases. It was mentioned that there is a need for further analysis to get the full
                utility out of the data. Next step is to investigate the types of analysis that will benefit the water
                department and to devise methods to implement those analyses. Additionally, other aspects of water
                infrastructure data are lacking and have significant gaps. For example according to Eric Lupher, Robert
                Schneider, and Eric Paul Dennis in Michigan's Path to a Prosperous Future: Infrastructure Challenges and
                Opportunities, “it will likely require decades of focused attention to attain an appropriate
                understanding of water infrastructure in Michigan,” due to these gaps in data and according to Olivia
                Rath in State of the State: Michigan's Infrastructure, "a lack of clear, publicly available and
                aggregated information about water infrastructure assets has impeded strategic maintenance and
                replacement.”</p>
            </br>
            <p>Another finding is that water infrastructure data can't always be standardized, nor is it always helpful
                for it to be standardized. Some point out that the state lacking a central repository of information
                about system size, water production and rates (Walton), and having “coordinated data aggregation can
                inform a systematic approach to” water infrastructure maintenance (Rath). Despite the supportive stance
                on the standardization of data, the interviewee in the contextual interview mentioned that there is no
                one size fits all template for data because every project is different. A balance should be struck
                between standardization for ease of access and customization to better elaborate on specific
                circumstances.</p>
            </br>
            <p>We also discovered that there are two main ways for water departments to select infrastructure for repair
                and maintenance, based on priority, according to our interview with an employee of the Ann Arbor Water
                Department. One is based on failures such as main breaks. If the data monitored by organizations shows
                pipes are in disrepair and need to be replaced, they get put on capital improvement projects. They
                assess the highest priorities to plan the financial matters. The other way is based on water quality.
                Contaminated water suggests decay in water pipes, and the water department decides to replace them.
                Decisions regarding repair and maintenance are made based on cost analysis. Whether it is cheaper to
                repair or replace will vary.</p>
            </br>
            <p>A finding about communication across municipalities is that there are research databases made available
                by the Water Research Foundation and American Waterworks Foundation as well as their local Michigan
                chapter.
                They collect data from research done by different municipalities. When organizations have projects they
                want to carry out,
                they can first take a look at the research databases to save time and resources.
                When facing issues, municipalities can also communicate with individual consultants and engineers who
                have worked for different water departments in addition to theirs.</p>
            </br>
            <p>Lastly, we learned that while the Department of Environment,
                Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE) recommends consolidation of water infrastructure, some are skeptical of
                this.
                The article by Natasha Blakely pointed out the population size in some municipalities is decreasing in
                spite of the initial expectation that it would grow bigger.
                In order to support the oversized water infrastructure, EGLE advocates for sharing resources between
                municipalities who are financially struggling to maintain their own by themselves. On the other hand,
                we cannot ignore that having a large distribution area creates a risk, as mentioned in our contextual
                interview with the Ann Arbor Water Department employee.
                With a larger consolidated area of water service, single problems will affect a larger amount of the
                population.
                Furthermore, pumping water throughout a bigger distribution area is expensive. The contextual interview
                further emphasized that states have to evaluate the financial benefit of infrastructure consolidation
                against the potential risk.</p>

                    with a broader range of stakeholders to resolve conflicting opinions and understand different
                    perspectives better. Additionally, we aim to access and delve deeper into two key databases—the
                    American Water Works Association and the Water Research Foundation—to improve our interview
                    questions. Lastly, exploring how transparency in infrastructure data affects funding decisions would
                    help us gain a deeper understanding of the issues from all stakeholders' viewpoints.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Through our data collection, we learned about some of the reasons why Michigan's water infrastructure is
                so unknown when it comes to its quality.
                We discovered a lack of comprehensive data when it comes to said quality, and that municipalities do
                already try their best to communicate findings with each other in indirect ways, such as through
                reporting databases they can publish to.
                We also found out data and infrastructure consolidation can yield contrary opinions. Some stakeholders
                are largely in favor, and some exhibit a request for caution. After reviewing our interview pool and
                data sources, we realized a lack of diverse stakeholders was a potential issue for missing parts of the
                whole picture.
                We determined that obtaining more stakeholder perspectives from water customers and political leaders
                would be paramount in furthering our project. We also figured that getting access to the two popular
                databases and observing user workflows through them would be invaluable for further exploration.
                Ultimately, there are clear efforts by various stakeholders to improve Michigan's water infrastructure.
                Having learned of the different aspects that Michigan water infrastructure is more ahead than we had
                previously thought, we feel more eager than wary about the future of Michigan's water infrastructure.
