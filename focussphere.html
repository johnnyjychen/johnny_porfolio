            <h2>Research Background</h2>
            <p>
                We conducted a literature review to understand the current challenges of ADHD and the existing
                solutions.
                We found that individuals with ADHD have trouble with their working memory, which is an ability to
                retain information for immediate use, and therefore they would have difficulty in
                accomplishing a lot of daily tasks.
                <span class="highlight">They usually suffer from losing things and cannot accomplish daily tasks well in
                    life. It is difficult
                    for them to concentrate
                    on completing tasks and distinguish the priorities of different tasks.</span> So, it is helpful and
                meaningful
                to design a product that could encourage them to form a daily habit to check their routine.

            <div class="solution">
                <p><span class="highlight">Existing Solutions</span>: There are some ways to help individuals with ADHD
                    improve their memory,
                    such as using visual aids and electronic reminders. The advantage of using visual aids is that it
                    helps individuals with ADHD understand, remember, and follow the information they receive.
                    However, individuals with ADHD might find it difficult to find effective visual aids in different
                    situations. Similarly with the use of calendars and reminders. These tools can work as a memory
                    assistant to support them; however, it is easier for them to get distracted when using electronic
                    devices.

                To further confirm the problem individuals with ADHD were facing,
                we recruited five interviewees from social media and conducted interviews on them.
                All of them were Asian adult women.
                Based on their responses, we found that they all had difficulties in prioritizing their tasks.

            <h3><span class="highlight">Tools' pros & cons and their affordability:</span></h3>
            <p>As for tech products, participants use different applications and platforms, such as calendar
                software and task-management software.
                Participants mentioned that mobile apps were convenient because they could automatically update
                tasks in other tools when connecting other platforms.
                Despite these advantages, there are some inherent drawbacks. One participant pointed out, “The act
                of opening an app is distracting, which can affect my short-term memory.”

            <h3><span class="highlight">Reminders are particularly beneficial</span>:</span></h3>
            <p>Some of our respondents mentioned that they forgot what they were going to do before they even opened the
                software they used
                to record it.
                One reason is that individuals with ADHD rely on external prompts rather than having to rely on
                their own efforts to remember tasks. Meanwhile, it is hard for them to prioritize their tasks,
                for example thinking that cleaning rooms is as important as studying for exams, so reminders from
                others are useful for them.

                complete their daily tasks instead of increasing their burden, it is necessary to make every feature
                in our design easy to learn how to use.
                As one participant mentioned, many things that she needed to do would interrupt each other, which
                would cause a lot of trouble in her life. If she only needed to enter what she thinks she needs to
                do every day at first, such as ordering takeout,
                and set it to remind her automatically every day, it would reduce her burden of using the software.
