            <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
            <p>
                Individuals with ADHD encounter challenges in effectively managing their daily tasks, compounded by
                difficulties in prioritizing these tasks.
                Therefore, we aimed to address this issue by developing an effective solution that not only assists
                these individuals in task management and completion
                but also helps determine the priorities of their day-to-day tasks.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="project_content">
            <h2>Research Background</h2>
            <p>
                We conducted a literature review to understand the current challenges of ADHD and the existing
                solutions.
                We found that individuals with ADHD have trouble with their working memory, which is an ability to
                retain information for immediate use, and therefore they would have difficulty in
                accomplishing a lot of daily tasks.
                They usually suffer from losing things and cannot accomplish daily tasks well in life. It is difficult
                for them to concentrate
                on completing tasks and distinguish the priorities of different tasks. So, it is helpful and meaningful
                to design a product that could encourage them to form a daily habit to check their routine.
            </p>
            </br>
            <p><span class="highlight">Existing Solutions</span>: There are some ways to help individuals with ADHD
                improve their memory,
                such as using visual aids and electronic reminders. The advantage of using visual aids is that it
                helps individuals with ADHD understand, remember, and follow the information they receive.
                However, individuals with ADHD might find it difficult to find effective visual aids in different
                situations. Similarly with the use of calendars and reminders. These tools can work as a memory
                assistant to support them; however, it is easier for them to get distracted when using electronic
                devices.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="project_content">
            <h2>User Interview</h2>
            <p>
                To further confirm the problem individuals with ADHD were facing,
                we recruited five interviewees from social media and conducted interviews on them.
                All of them were Asian adult women.
                Based on their responses, we found that they all had difficulties in prioritizing their tasks.
                The followings were some valuable insights:
            </p></br>
            <ol>
                <li><span class="highlight">Tools' pros & cons and their affordability</span>:
                    As for tech products, participants use different applications and platforms, such as calendar
                    software and task-management software.
                    Participants mentioned that mobile apps were convenient because they could automatically update
                    tasks in other tools when connecting other platforms.
                    Despite these advantages, there are some inherent drawbacks. One participant pointed out, “The act
                    of opening an app is distracting, which can affect my short-term memory.”
                    Another participant echoed a similar sentiment, stating, “I tried to use reminders on my phone
                    before as well but I would even forget to open the reminder.”</li></br>
                <li><span class="highlight">Reminders are particularly beneficial</span>: Some of our respondents
                    mentioned that they forgot what they were going to do before they even opened the software they used
                    to record it.
                    One reason is that individuals with ADHD rely on external prompts rather than having to rely on
                    their own efforts to remember tasks. Meanwhile, it is hard for them to prioritize their tasks,
                    for example thinking that cleaning rooms is as important as studying for exams, so reminders from
                    others are useful for them.</li></br>
                <li><span class="highlight">Our design should not be a burden</span>: Our goal is to help them better
                    complete their daily tasks instead of increasing their burden, it is necessary to make every feature
                    in our design easy to learn how to use.
                    As one participant mentioned, many things that she needed to do would interrupt each other, which
                    would cause a lot of trouble in her life. If she only needed to enter what she thinks she needs to
                    do every day at first, such as ordering takeout,
                    and set it to remind her automatically every day, it would reduce her burden of using the software.
